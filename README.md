# mev-relay

This repository contains a public relay for accepting transactions from searchers. It also contains an example reverse proxy for miners to run in front of their mev-geth nodes. This relay is meant only to protect participating miners from abuse via DoS attacks, but does otherwise no bundle filtering or censoring.

## Public Relay

[This is the relay entrypoint](server/main.js). The public flashbots relay is available at https://relay.flashbots.net. See https://github.com/flashbots/ethers-provider-flashbots-bundle for a library to help you call this.

The relay provides new JSON-RPC methods for interfacing with Flashbots. They are documented below:

### eth_sendBundle

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [signedTxs, blockNumber, minTimestamp, maxTimestamp]
}
```

- **signedTxs**: Array[String], A list of signed transactions to execute in an atomic bundle
- **blockNumber**: String, a hex encoded block number for which this bundle is valid on
- **minTimestamp(Optional)**: Number, the minimum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch
- **maxTimestamp(Optional)**: Number, the minimum timestamp for which this bundle is valid, in seconds since the unix epoch

Example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [["0x123abc...", "0x456def..."], "0xb63dcd", 0, 1615920932]
}
```

### eth_callBundle

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_sendBundle",
  "params": [signedTxs, targetBlockNumber, stateBlockNumber, timestamp]
}
```

- **signedTxs**: Array[String], A list of signed transactions to execute in an atomic bundle
- **targetBlockNumber**: String, a hex encoded block number for which this bundle is valid on
- **stateBlockNumber**: String, either a hex encoded number or a block tag for which state to base this simulation on. Can use "latest"
- **timestamp(Optional)**: Number, the timestamp to use for this bundle simulation, in seconds since the unix epoch

Example:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_callBundle",
  "params": [["0x123abc...", "0x456def..."], "0xb63dcd", "latest", 1615920932]
}
```

### flashbots_getUserStats

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "flashbots_getUserStats",
  "params": [blockNumber]
}
```

- **blockNumber**: String, a hex encoded recent block number, in order to prevent replay attacks. Must be within 20 blocks of the current chain tip.

Returns a quick summary of how this searcher is performing in the relay:

```json
{
  "signing_address": "0x123...",
  "blocks_won_total": 283,
  "bundles_submitted_total": 8503,
  "bundles_error_total": 0,
  "avg_gas_price_gwei": 73.43275884220039,
  "blocks_won_last_7d": 283,
  "bundles_submitted_last_7d": 8503,
  "bundles_error_7d": 0,
  "avg_gas_price_gwei_last_7d": 73.43275884220039,
  "blocks_won_last_1d": 83,
  "bundles_submitted_last_1d": 757,
  "bundles_error_1d": 0,
  "avg_gas_price_gwei_last_1d": 227.44116622595683,
  "blocks_won_last_1h": 0,
  "bundles_submitted_last_1h": 38,
  "bundles_error_1h": 0,
  "avg_gas_price_gwei_last_1h": 103.30447379959334,
  "blocks_won_last_5m": 0,
  "bundles_submitted_last_5m": 0,
  "bundles_error_5m": 0,
  "avg_gas_price_gwei_last_5m": null
}
```

- **blocks_won**: This number represents how many blocks were won by this user, according to the relay. This is **not** how many ended up on chain, this is just what our relay thinks would've won.
- **avg_gas_price_gwei**: The adjusted gas price, averaged over all submissions by this user.

## Authentication

This relay requires that all payloads are signed with an ethereum wallet.

The signature is calculated by taking the EIP-191 hash of the json body encoded as UTF-8 bytes. Here's an example using ethers.js:

```js
body = '{"id": 1234, "method", "eth_sendBundle", "params": [["0x123..."], "0xB84969"]}'
wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
wallet.signMessage(ethers.utils.id(body))
```

or in web3py:

```py
from web3 import Web3
from eth_account import Account, messages

body = '{"id": 1234, "method", "eth_sendBundle", "params": [["0x123..."], "0xB84969"]}'
message = messages.encode_defunct(text=Web3.keccak(text=body).hex())
signed_message = Account.sign_message(message, private_key=private_key_hex)
```

or in go:

```go
hashedBody := crypto.Keccak256Hash([]byte(body)).Hex()
sig, err := crypto.Sign(crypto.Keccak256([]byte("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n"+strconv.Itoa(len(hashedBody))+hashedBody)), pk)
signature := addr.Hex() + ":" + hexutil.Encode(sig)
```

Take this signature and append it to the ethereum address of the signer, separated by a colon, `:`. Then send it in the `X-Flashbots-Signature` HTTP header like so:

```
X-Flashbots-Signature: 0x95c622A2c597a8bdC26D371Dd3D57dA9D26052DF:0xc73d4790fed41954869625c159a4617e3374019839a8ad72de15e41371719d6873c780e00293fcdc100aa505f33dd8480e7b07551483c8c438fe8236972d26ca1c
```

This signer does not have to be related to the signer of your actual transactions. It is just used for authentication/rate limiting purposes, and is how `flashbots_getUserStats` determines the user.

## Miners

See [https://github.com/flashbots/mev-proxy](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-proxy) for an example reverse proxy that this relay can connect to. Also, take a look at [https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth)
